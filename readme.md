# Inroduction
This is the source code of our paper "A Two-student Learning Framework for Mixed Supervised Target Sound Detection"  The paper can be found on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02088.pdf <br>
# How to run it
You can extract the feature according our code, or directly using our extracted feature (we will release it soon). Afther that you can directly run "bash bash/*.sh" .The different experiments can be choose from bash folder.
# To do list
(1) we will release the extracted feature and our paper as soon. <br>
(2) Re-organize the code, make it easy to read. <br>
(3) Considering I have too much open source code to maintain, it is hard for me to organize the structure well. But if you have any problem, please contact me without hesitation.
